We are using a docstring to comment out 
multiple lines of code in Python. Below, the 
Python interpreter will allocate some memory,
and store that number 1000 in that memory 
location. Then it will have the variable 
students_count reference that memory location.
The variable students_count is just like a label
for that memory location. Data is stored in that 
memory location. 

Primitive types can be: Numbers, Booleans, and Strings.
No distinctions between the Floats and the Integers.
